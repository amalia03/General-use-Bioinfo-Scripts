All the well written scripts I have written along with the help of LMJ for my PhD project

###follow_alignment_progress

This directory contains two files, "use_align_speed.sh" and "align_speed.sh". 
The commands were written to follow the progress of the alignment output. 
The command **"align_speed.sh"** outputs the line number it currently processes in the FASTA file.
The command **"use_align_speed.sh"** initates the second command every n hours for a total t hours (default are 3 and 120 respectively).
